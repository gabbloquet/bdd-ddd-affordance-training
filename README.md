# BDD, DDD, Affordance training

This repository is a boot camp to try to implement BDD, DDD, affordance.  

Firstly, I tried to work on a TODO list example.

## Documentation

1. I started by working on [gherkins](./doc/gherkins.md)
2. Then, tried to discover [affordance tools](./doc/affordance.md)
3. Working on an [architecture schema](./doc/architecture.md)
4. [Service development](./service/README.md)

## Next steps

1. Make an amazing todolist service, [more informations here](./service/README.md)
2. Try to implement a front-end to be compliant with it
3. Make the whole app works :tada:
4. Try to work on another example -> _Provide me ideas with [issues](https://github.com/gabbloquet/bdd-ddd-affordance-training/issues)_

###

For now this application is just a back office.  
The easiest ways to test it is : 
 - Performs tests [./service/src/test/java](./service/src/test/java) (If you use IntelliJ -> Left click -> `Run 'All Tests'`)
 - [Use this postman collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/29ec62bd3b5ed531c0b5) (Copy paste this content in `File` -> `Import` -> `Raw text`)
