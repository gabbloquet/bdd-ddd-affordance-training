# BDD, DDD, Affordance training

This repository is a boot camp to try to implement BDD, DDD, affordance.  

Firstly, I tried to work on a TODO list example.

## Documentation

1. I started by working on [gherkins](./doc/gherkins.md)
2. Then, tried to discover [affordance tools](./doc/affordance.md)
3. Working on an [architecture schema](./doc/architecture.md)
4. [Service documentation](./service/README.md)

## Next steps

1. Make affordance works
2. Try to implement a front-end to be compliant with it
3. Make the whole app works
4. Try to work on another example
