# Domain driven design

## Thanks to BDD

**Behavior driven development** helps use to bring out a business vocabulary.  
Thanks to that we can name every class, function or attribute in a business way.  

## Other stuff

We can find in [annotations directory](../service/src/main/java/io/github/gabbloquet/todolist/application/annotations) the domain design vocabulary and therefore find classes which are from this type.  

To match with **Domain driven design** we have :
 - Adapters
 - Aggregates
 - (Domain) commands
 - (Domain) entities
 - (Domain) events
 - (Domain) repositories
 - (Domain) services
 - Port

You can find in the dedicated files definitions and resources.
